            description: 'Dire Wolf came about one day as I was swiping other animals on canvas. I had decided that I wanted to do a swiped animal series and I did a couple of foxes to start. Dire Wolf popped up in my head but because of my schedule I was not able to paint for at least a couple of weeks. He was designed virtually over and over again. By the time I was actually able to paint he just flowed right out of the brush and swiping technique. I think my love of animals helps me create the different characteristics my swiped animals portray.',
